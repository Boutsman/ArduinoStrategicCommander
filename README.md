# ArduinoStrategicCommander

Materials used:
- Arduino mini
- USB-cable
- Through hole prototyping pcb
- Push buttons
- Single-core wire

Many programs have a lot of functions of which you just use a few in your daily work. Because of this I made a little controller that simulates keyboard-presses.   This way I don't have to remember the hotkey combinations for every program.

An extra button makes it possible to cycle through different present.

Future updates:
- Record keyboard presses into the device
